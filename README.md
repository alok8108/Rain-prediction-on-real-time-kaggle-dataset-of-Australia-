# Rain-prediction-on-real-time-kaggle-dataset-of-Australia-
This project deals in rain prediction using Decision Tree and random forest for the real time dataset. Here we have also done hyperparameter tuning to make model efficient
First we trained using the Decision tree and then realized that by optimizing the hyperparameters such as:
1.max depth 
2.max nodes 
we can get efficient results .

The model works on the following versions :
opendatasets == 0.1.22
pandas == 1.5.3
numpy == 1.22.4
scikit-learn == 1.3.0
seaborn == 0.12.2
python == 3.10.6
